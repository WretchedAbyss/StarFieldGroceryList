# StarFieldGroceryList
## Description
I created a database from the wiki using my knowledge of the game to fill in the gaps and make it functional.
I then used FastHTML a Python web Library in order to visualize it in a drop down. 
It allows you to search the database with suggestions. Then, it maps out the recipe for a craftable item in a colour-coded tree structure and denotes the amount of the item it would take to make the item you added.
It functions basically like a Todo app but with a recursive tree which shows how everything is crafted, always down to the base materials in the game, multiplying based on how many you have in the grocery list.
